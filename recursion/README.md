fibonnaci.rb
    Write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns that many members of the fibonacci sequence. Use iteration for this solution.
    Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just 3 lines (or 1 if you're crazy, but don't consider either of these lengths a requirement... just get it done).

mergesort.rb
    We spent some time early on dealing with sorting (e.g. bubble sort). Now it's time to take another look at sorting with Merge Sort, a type of sort that lends itself well to recursion and can be much faster than bubble sort on the right data sets. You'll build a method which sorts a given array but uses a "merge sort" method for doing so.

    It can be a bit strange to wrap your head around, but just remember you're "dividing and conquering" the problem.
